        <p>Get ready to shred some sand. Ever since 1918,
          the most austere sporting event was created- making
          room for the most radical thrill-seekers to put
          their racing vigor to the test. You have been blessed
          with witnessing the beast of the Middle East, the most
          extreme racing events not known to many.
